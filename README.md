# bootnextr

A (hastily-written) Rust CLI to help manipulate BootNext NVRAM variable.

What is that jargon? Basically, if you dual-boot, and everytime you swap OS, you have to spam ESC or some other keys to open up the boot entry select menu, you will probably like this.

This selects the OS (or boot entry) that will be used ONLY on **the next time** your machine boots, without having to spam the key.
